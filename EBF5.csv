"Oh snap, I\'m down to my last few hit points again. \nHis attacks do so much damage - it\'s not fair!                   \n\nAnd his stupid attack pattern keeps changing every time!",狗屎，我又在快赢的时候挂了。\n他的攻击伤害超高，一点都不平衡！                   \n\n而且他那狗屁攻击模式每次都不一样。
"I\'ve only got one life left - if I lose again I\'m going all the way back to the start.             \n\nI\'ve got other things to do, I don\'t want to be trapped in here forever!",我只剩一条命——要是输了的话我就得重新开始。             \n\n我还有别的事情要做，我可不想一直耗在这里！
"Aha! There\'s his weak spot! \nIf I can just stab him in the eye a few more times, then... maybe…",啊哈！这里是他的弱点！\n要是我能戳多几下他的眼睛，也许……可以……
I DID IT! HE\'S DEAD!         \n\nI finally finished the game!,成·功·了，他·挂·了！         \n\n终于把这款游戏给打通了。
It only took me 23 tries to beat the final boss!         \n\nI\'m such a pro!,我只重开了23次就干掉了最终BOSS！         \n\n老子不愧是游戏达人！
This ending is kind of lame though. \nI spent weeks collecting every single item... and this is all I get?           \n\nI hope there\'s more to it than this-,这结局可真够垃圾的。\n我用了几个星期来收集全部要素……就给我看这样的结局？           \n\n我还盼望着能有别的内容——
WHAT THE HELL?!              \n\nWhat the crap was that?,搞·什·么·鬼·啊？！              \n\n这是什么垃圾剧情？
"Is Hope Harbor being invaded by pirates again? \nNah, there\'s no way that pirates would have that much firepower... right?",希望港又被海盗侵略了？\n不是吧，海盗根本不可能有这么多的火力……是吧？
I\'m not gonna let this slide. \nWhoever did this to my TV is gonna pay!        \n\nI didn\'t even get to see the rest of the ending!,这事我不会就此罢休的。\n无论是谁，弄坏我电视的人都要付出代价！        \n\n剩余的结局我都还没来得及看呢！
Here we go. \nI can use this old hockey stick as a weapon. \nI think that should be enough equipment for now.,我们出发吧。 \n我的武器就选这把旧曲棍。\n我觉得现阶段这装备已经够用了。
"Hmmm, I think I\'m ready to go.    \nMaybe I should grab some snacks from the fridge too…",嗯，我觉得我已经准备好出发了。    \n我是不是该从冰箱中带走一些零食……
"Huh, old Jerry doesn\'t seem to be home.       \n\nI wonder what happened to him? \nHe never goes out…",嘿，老杰瑞好像没有回家。       \n\n不知道他出了什么事？\n他以前都不外出的……
"Hmm, using mouse controls for secrets like this feels a bit like cheating.           \n\nI guess I\'ve got the option to walk around with the keyboard if I want a more classic JRPG experience.",嗯，用鼠标操作来找隐藏地点感觉就像是作弊一样。           \n\n如果想要更加经典的日式RPG体验，我觉得用键盘来操作会更好。
Meow?,喵？
"This cat probably doesn\'t know what I\'m talking about...        \nOld JRPGs had some cryptic secrets, yo.",这只猫可能不知道我在说什么……        \n以前的日式RPG都会有一些隐藏的秘密哟。
Huh?             \n\nI forgot that I had a room back here…,哈？             \n\n我可不记得这后面有房间。
Eh...               \n\nIt smells in here.,呃……               \n\n这里好难闻。
Meow...                \nMeow!,喵……                \n喵！
"Well you would like it, wouldn\'t you? \nCats love filth!",好吧，你喜欢这里，对吧？\n猫咪最喜欢脏东西了！
Myeh...,喵唬……
"I like passing through here to look at the swords, but I\'ve never had the cash to actually buy anything. \nThe shopkeeper always gives me a mean look - I think he\'s hiding a dark secret.",经过这里的时候，我总喜欢停下脚步欣赏这些剑，不过我从来没花钱买过任何东西。\n店员总是给我使白眼，他现在也藏在某个阴暗的角落里吧。
"Eh, there\'s some odd types in here today.               \n\nNever seen it so busy before.",呃，今天这里有些反常。               \n\n以前都没见过有这么忙的。
"Meh, meow? \nMeeeow?",喵，喵？ \n喵~~？
"Nah, this place won\'t give any leftovers to bums like you. \n(I\'ve tried it myself…)",不，这地方不会有剩饭留给你这样的懒鬼。\n（我以前试过……）
"Woah, what the hell? \nThere\'s a huge fireball in the sky!",哇，那是什么鬼？\n天上居然有个大火球！
"Oh wait, I see - that\'s just the sun.       \n\nHaven\'t seen that in a while... I better be careful out here.",哦，等下，我知道了——那只是太阳。       \n\n有一小会没见到它了……下次从这出来时我得注意这点。
"There\'s some monsters up ahead - one might even call them \""foes\"".            \nAnd if I know anything about foes, it\'s that they drop loot when they\'re defeated - so it\'s time to get to work!",前面有怪物出没，有人称它们为“敌怪”。            \n而且据我所知，敌怪被打败时会掉落战利品。所以说，开工啦！
But they\'re just standing around peacefully for some reason. \nI might have to talk to them to spark things off…,不过由于一些原因，它们只会在周围和平地站着。\n我需要跟它们对话来触发战斗……
What\'s this? \nI sense an ambush up ahead...        \n\nDoes he think I can\'t see him?,那是什么？\n我发现前面有伏兵……        \n\n他是认为我没有看到他吗？
"I think it\'s the cat that\'s been stealing my trash. \nWell I\'ve had a few practice battles, I bet I can take on a cat now!",它就是那只一直在偷翻我垃圾的猫吧。\n我已经经历过几次战斗了，我想我现在的实力足以对付一只猫。
"Stay back, you beast! \nYou can\'t trick me with your crocodile tears! \nWhy were you stealing my garbage?",退后，你个野兽！\n你那假到不行的眼泪是骗不了我的！\n你为什么要偷我的垃圾？
Meeeowwww.…,喵呜呜呜呜……
"What\'s that? You want to join my party? \nYou may be a worthy ally after all, little cat.          \n\nWhat\'s your name?",什么？你要加入我的队伍？\n好吧，也许你能帮上我的忙，小猫咪。          \n\n你叫什么名字？
Meow!,喵！
"NoLegs? What a strange yet fitting name! \nI was planning on cooking you, but I\'ll keep you around for a while instead. \nWe can be partners in crim- er, adventure!",腿无？好奇怪的名字，不过还挺适合的！\n我原本打算把你煮了吃，不过现在姑且留你在身边。\n我们能成为犯——呃，冒险同盟！
M-meow?,喵、喵？
"Yeah, that\'s right. \nI\'m on a quest for revenge, and also for treasure!         \n\nStick with me and we\'ll be rich in no time!",没错，你说得对。\n我现在正进行着复仇和寻宝的任务！         \n\n跟我混吧，我们很快就会变得很有钱！
"Hey, we\'re both getting quite good at whacking foes. \nMaybe we should try learning some new attacks in the \""Skills\"" menu?",嘿，我们俩是越来越擅长对付敌怪了。\n我们是不是应该在“技能”菜单中学点新的攻击招式？
Meow...?  \nMeow!?,喵……？ \n喵！？
"Yeah, I think that\'s how we spend the Ability Points we get from battles!",没错，从战斗中获得的能力点能用在那里。
"Oh no, I remember these people. \nThey always try to convince me to collect crap for them.        \n\nWell I\'m not going to be an errand boy!",糟糕，我想起这些人了。\n他们总要我为他们收集废品。        \n\n我可不想变成跑腿男孩！
"Meow, meow... meow!",喵，喵……喵！
You think they\'ll reward us with something good? \nI really doubt that - they don\'t look very rich.,你觉得他们会给我们好东西作为回报？\n我不怎么信，他们看上去不是很有钱。
What\'s with all of these block puzzles? \nWho designs this crap and just leaves it outside to torment me?,这些推箱子谜题怎么搞啦？\n谁设计的这狗屎玩意，还把它放在外面让我受苦？
"Wow, we\'re making bank already! \nThese foes are just standing around and waiting for us to rob them! \nAnd there\'s so many treasure chests just lying around!",哇，我们能开银行了！\n那些敌怪只会站着等我们去抢劫！\n而且周围还放有这么多的宝箱！
Meow!,喵！
"Yeah, you\'re a pretty good ally!      \n\nI think I\'ll let you keep 10% of our treasure, since you\'re about ten times smaller than me and don\'t need so much stuff.",没错，你是个出色的盟友！      \n\n不过你的体型比我小十倍，不需要那么多的材料，所以我会分给你10%的宝物。
*not pleased at all*,*一点都不开心*
"Woah, what in the name of Godcat is that? \nThat giant black rock isn\'t supposed to be there!          \n\nDid it fall from the sky? Is that what shook my house?",哇，请你用猫神名义告诉我，那是什么？ \n那个巨大的黑色石头不该出现在那里！          \n\n它是从天上掉下来的吗？是它引起我房子的震动吗？
*hisses at the monolith*,*对着巨石发出了嘶嘶声*
"Yeah, I agree. \nThis looks like a bad omen of some sort.       \n\nI feel like it\'s watching me somehow - even though it\'s just a stupid rock!",是啊，我也觉得是这样。\n这看起来像是某种不详的预兆。       \n\n我总觉得它在用某种方法观察着我——虽然它只是块烂石头！
"Lame - these side roads are blocked off by dirt! \nA shovel would really help, and I bet we can steal one at the Farmer\'s Market.       \n\nWe just gotta keep pushing forward until we find a way there…",混蛋——岔路都被泥石给挡住了！\n要是有铲子就好了，我觉得我们能从农家市场偷来一把。       \n\n在找到去市场的路前，我们也只能往前走了……
"Hold on, I\'m not sure if this is mentioned anywhere... But I think I can close menus by right-clicking anywhere! \nThat could speed things up a bit... ",等下，我不知道之前有没有在哪说过……我可以右键任意地方关闭菜单！\n这方法应该能让运行顺畅一点点……
"Hmm, it looks like we heal quite quickly outside of battle. \nBut it\'s not instant, so we might have to wait a minute sometimes…",嗯，看来我们不在战斗时，生命值能快速地恢复。\n不过并不是马上就治好，所以我们得等上一小会……
I guess that\'s a chance to upgrade some skills or equipment!,这段时间我们可以用来升级技能或是装备！
"Ah, here we go. This is the Farmer\'s Market.        \nWe can grab that shovel over there, and maybe a few other things if we don\'t get caught.",啊，我们到了。这里就是农家市场。        \n过去那边我们就能抢到铲子了，要是我们没被抓住，也许还能顺走一些别的东西。
Meow!,喵！
"Yeah, I thought you might be up for a bit of thievery. \nWe make a good team!",好啦，我会分给你一些赃物。\n我们可是最好的队伍！
"A-are you okay? How are you feeling? \nWe weren\'t trying to cause any major trouble, I promise.",你、你还好吗？感觉怎么样？\n我们没想过要惹是生非的，我发誓。

Can we forget this whole confrontation ever happened? \nLet\'s move away from here before anyone starts asking questions…,我们就当无事发生，好吗？\n趁现在没人问起这件事，我们最好开溜……

"Oh, you\'re right! \nI think she\'s sobering up.            \nGotta make up an alibi fast!",哦，你说得对！\n我想她正在清醒过来。            \n得快点做好不在场证明。
What happened to me? \nDid the thieves get away?,我是怎么了？\n小偷都走了吗？
"Hey, we\'re Matt and NoLegs, just a bunch of chumps looking to fight monsters and do good deeds. \n\nYup, that\'s us. \nYou just fainted for a while.",嘿，我们是马特和腿无，两个只打怪和只做好事的木头人。\n\n是的，我们就是这样的人。\n你只是晕过去了一会。
"Oh, I remember now. \nYou jerks were caught stealing, and then YOU ATTACKED ME!           \n\nPlease explain yourselves.",哦，我想起来了。\n你们两个混蛋在偷东西被抓了个现行，然后你们就袭·击·了·我！           \n\n你们最好解释解释。
"Super sorry about that. \nWe just didn\'t want to go to jail - we didn\'t even steal anything valuable yet. \nWe\'re still stretching our wings and learning the ropes around here, or something like that.",超级抱歉啦。\n我们只是不想进监狱，我们都还没偷过任何值钱的东西。\n我们还处于伸展翅膀和学习套索等诸如此类技巧的过程中。
"(Hmm, maybe I can use these morons for the time being... if they\'ll cooperate.)",（嗯，要是能与他们合作，也许我能暂时利用这些傻瓜……）
"Well you put up a good fight at least. Perhaps we can work together for a while.         \nThere\'s a lot of monsters around lately - probably due to that meteor. \nI\'ve been sent on a mission to investigate the monoliths that fell alongside it, and could use some help.",好吧，至少你打架的功力还不错。也许我们能暂时进行合作。         \n也许是受陨石的影响，最近这周围多了很多怪物。\n我是被派来调查这些坠落的石碑，我需要一些帮手。
"We\'re on a mission too - to find treasure, and food, and to get stronger! \nWe\'ve already learned a lot out here.",我们也有自己的任务，像是找宝物，找食物，以及让自己变得更强大！\n我们在这已经学到不少东西了。
Meowth! \n(That\'s right!),喵嘶！\n（说得没错）
"Alright then, let\'s use that shovel you\'ve \""borrowed\"" and head to the coast. \nWith all of the bridges having been knocked out, our only way off of this island is through the Ice Cave to the south-east.         \n\nThere might be a few big monsters along the way - but nothing we can\'t handle together!",好吧，那我们就利用你“借来”的铲子前往海边吧。\n不过所有桥梁都被震断了，东南边的冰窟是我们离开这座岛的唯一出路。         \n\n路上也许会有几只大怪，不过只要我们齐心合力，就没有事情能难倒我们的！
"Ya, hear that NoLegs? \nWe\'re going on a proper adventure, far away from home!",呀，听到了吗，腿无？\n我们真的要踏上远离家乡的冒险了！

Ace! There\'s more stuff back here! \nWe can sneak past the shopkeepers like ninjas!,好极了！这后面有更多的材料！\n我们能像忍者一样从店员眼皮下偷偷溜过去！
"Aha, there\'s something hidden back here. \nAlmost missed this one.",啊哈，这后面藏有东西。\n差点就漏了这个。
Really? \nWe\'re gonna steal from this friendly family?,真要这么做吗？\n真的要从这个善人之家偷走东西吗？
"I\'m sorry Natalie, but this is just how the game is played. \nI\'m sure you\'ll get used to it eventually.",我也感到难过，娜塔莉，不过这游戏就是这么设计的。\n你迟早都会习惯的。
"*sigh*             \n\n(I\'m gonna make this right someday, I swear.)",*叹气*             \n\n（天地为鉴，总有一天我要纠正这种错误。）

Yeah? \nWhat\'s up?,呃？\n有什么事吗？

"Oh, I don\'t like puzzle games.         \n\nThose kind of suck, in my opinion.",哦，我可不喜欢益智游戏。         \n\n它们会让我觉得恶心。
Whatever.,不管哪一种都一样。
"Hey, there\'s some shops near here, right? \nI think this is a good chance to grab any healing items we\'re short on, and upgrade some equipment.         \n\nOh, and get some snacks for NoLegs, too!",嘿，这附近有商店，对吧？\n我想这是天赐良机，我们可以借走我们短缺的恢复道具，还可以升级一些装备。         \n\n哦对了，还要给腿无拿点食物！
"Mehehe, Meow! \nMeow!",喵呵呵，喵！\n喵！
"What do you mean? Are you saying she\'d make a better leader than me? \nAre you going to betray me already, NoLegs? \nDon\'t make me regret not eating you.",你什么意思？你是说她当队长比我当的好？\n你是要背叛我吗，腿无？\n别让我后悔没吃掉你。
Meow…,喵……
That\'s a horrible thing to say to your pet! \nYou can\'t treat NoLegs like that!,你怎么能对你的宠物说这种鬼话！\n你不能这么对待腿无！
"(Oh, she\'s mad...)               \n\nHeh heh heh, I\'m totally just kidding, right NoLegs?",（哦，她开始抓狂了……）               \n\n呵呵呵，我只是在开玩笑，对吧腿无？
…,……
"This stone block looks big, but it\'s actually surprisingly light. \nEven NoLegs could push it.          \n\nWe can just push it out of the way and continue south.",这块挡路的石头看起来很大，却意外的很轻。\n就连腿无都能推得动。          \n\n只要推开它我们就能继续往南走了。
"Okay, that thing over there by the cave is definitely a boss.",好吧，那边那个守着洞窟的家伙肯定就是BOSS了。
"Yeah, that\'s the Ice Cave! \nLet\'s look around first and not rush into this.",没错，那边就是冰窟！\n先别急着冲过去，我们在周围先观察观察。
"Yeah, we did it! \nI was worried for a while, but we really showed him who\'s boss!         \nI think we really balance out each other\'s weaknesses, and make a great team.",喔，我们成功了！\n刚开始我还有点担心，不过我们用实力证明了谁才是真正的BOSS！         \n我们很好地弥补了各自的短处，这队伍真是超级棒。
I just hit things with my sword. \nI\'m glad you\'ve got every other position covered.,我只会用剑砍东西。\n有你看着其它方面的事情真是太好了。
"You should give yourself more credit! \nYou\'re tough and won\'t go down easily, that helps a lot in battles like these!",你要自信点！\n你很耐打，不容易倒下，这点在战斗中很有用！
"He kept hitting me, but I wanted to win so badly that I took the hits and just kept on fighting. \nSometimes the pain just made me angrier and even stronger!           \n\n(Am I finally useful? Have I found my purpose in life?!)",他一直在打我，不过我太想赢了，所以我没怎么在意，一心想着和他干到底。\n有时伤痛只会让我变得更加愤怒，甚至是变得更强！           \n\n（我终于派上用场了吗？我是不是找到了人生的意义？！）
"Meow, meow!",喵，喵！
"I-it\'s not like that! \nAnd of course we haven\'t forgotten about you, NoLegs. \nYou fought awesomely too.",不是这样的！\n我们当然没有忘记你的功劳，腿无。\n你也干的很漂亮。

Or did I die and go to heaven?          \nThat might be more likely…,还是说我是死后上天堂了？          \n我想是这种可能性更高……

"So apparently we\'ve earned enough of a reputation to be allowed in here, huh? \nI guess we\'re moving up in the world.",所以从结论上讲，我们已经获得了足够的人气继续待在这里，对吧？\n我觉得我们的地位正在提升。

Such lewdness...           \n\nIncredible…,太下流了……           \n\n真不敢相信……
Wow...        \n\nJust wow…,哇……        \n\n我只能说哇……
I thought the pose was a bit too suggestive... So I wanted to keep this photo private. \n(I was also a bit chubbier at the time... and got some really mean comments about it…),这姿势有点过于让人浮想联翩了吧……所以我要把这张照片收归己有。\n（那时我还长得有点胖……还有人因此写下了非常刻薄的留言。）

Are my boobs really that big?          \n\nI\'m surprised that some people can be so obsessed with them.                \nMaybe I should be used to this sort of attention by now...?,我的胸部有那么大吗？          \n\n我很好奇为什么会有人沉迷于这种东西。                \n也许我该习惯这种眼光……？

"Pffft, nonsense. \nThey\'ve been made to look more impressive in painting form. \nThey weren\'t so tough in real life.",切，乱说。\n为了增强印象，在画里它们都是经过艺术处理的。\n现实中的它们可没那么强。

"I\'m a real cutie, huh?",我很可爱，对吧？
See? Just like this!,看到了吗？就像这幅画一样！
"This is totally me. \nI\'m obviously ripped like that. \nI don\'t have a beer belly at all, those are just lies.",这才是我。\n很明显我和这幅画一样是个肌肉男。\n我可是连一丁点啤酒肚都没有，那些画都是骗子画的。

(You gotta grow up first…),（首先你得像个大人……）
"Wow, I look so realistic here! \nWell, compared to my current deformed cartoon form.",哇，这幅画里的我看起来像是真的一样！\n最起码比我这副丑陋的卡通形象要好。
(I\'m feeling so pudgy right now…),（我现在觉得我这形象太矮了……）
"Woahhhh, this is me?              \nSo cool!",哇嗷嗷，这是我吗？              \n太酷了！

The background\'s so pretty! \nThis looks like somewhere I\'d love to be - it looks a lot like Greenwood!,这背景画得真好！\n看起来就像是我以前常去的地方，真的很像绿木村！

"Holy Godcat, have we found heaven?! \nThis is... everything is made of gold!",我的猫神，我们是到了天堂吗？！\n这里……所有东西都是用金子做的！

(I... forgot to wipe my shoes…),（我……忘了擦干净我的鞋……）
"I know this is just concept art, but I\'m glad that some of these monstrosities didn\'t make it into the game.",虽然我知道它只是张设定图，不过我还是很庆幸这里的一些怪物没被做进游戏里面。
"Some of the older EBF games had turtles in them, right?",前作有龟型怪物，对吧？
"Yeah, but they didn\'t look quite like this. \nThese are a bit different.",是的，不过它们看起来不怎么像。\n存在着一些差异。
A bird that poops eggs at you? An overturned ice cream cone?           \n\nThese would be joke enemies if they existed! \nI require something much more challenging.,会向你排泄蛋蛋的鸟？翻转的冰淇凌蛋卷？           \n\n把他们当成敌人简直是笑话！ \n我需要更有挑战性的敌人。
"Wow, these monster designs are dumb. \nThese are for kids - they look really cartoony and silly.",哇，这些怪物的设计看起来太蠢了。\n这是给小孩子看的吧，它们看起来太卡通了，简直蠢到爆。
"You ARE a cartoon! \nYou know that, right?",你也是卡通人物！\n你知道这点，对吧？
"Pffft, not like this though. \nI\'ve got style.",切，和它们才不一样呢。\n我更有型。
"Hey NoLegs, are you really a cyborg like this sketch here? \nBecause that would give me much cause for concern. \nWhat would we find if we dissected you?",嘿，腿无，你真的像这幅素描里所画的一样是只赛博猫吗？\n我真的很好奇。\n要是我们把你切开，我们能发现什么吗？

"I\'d like to say that spiders are the sign of a healthy household, but if they get that big then you might have a problem. \nYou need to get the flamethrower out at some point.",让我给你科普吧，蜘蛛是一个健康家庭的标志，不过要是它们变得太大，你可能会觉得麻烦。\n这时候你就要亮出你的火焰喷射器。
"Huh, it seems that some of the skimpy outfits in this game were designed by a woman? \nIt looks like even the ladies want to show off my curves. \nI\'m cursed with a body that cannot be contained.",呃，游戏内部分暴露的外装设计是由女士操刀的？\n看来就连女人也想让我展示自己的曼妙曲线。\n我是中了衣不蔽体的诅咒。
"Wow, what a curse. \nIt must be so hard to have everyone throwing themselves at your feet. \n(I\'m obviously not jealous or anything…)",哇，好厉害的诅咒。\n让所有人都拜倒在你的石榴裙下一定很不容易吧。\n（我真的没有在嫉妒……）
M-meow...!,喵、喵……！

(Who is he talking to? Is someone watching us?),（他在和谁说话？有谁在暗中观察我们吗？）
"H-hey, wait. There\'s something I need to ask...             \nSince we teamed up I\'ve been having this weird sense of déjà vu. \nHave we met before? \nOr am I remembering some sort of dream?",嘿、嘿，等等。我有一些问题想问……            \n自从组队以来我都有一种奇怪的既视感。\n我们以前见过面吗？\n还是说在我脑海里的画面只是某种梦境。
"Now that you mention it...               \nThis is starting to feel like some of the RPGs I\'ve played, yeah! \nIt\'s a really common trope: A guy meets a girl under funny circumstances and they start travelling together.",既然你说起这件事……               \n没错，这种感觉就像是我玩过的RPG游戏！\n这开场真的很普通：在奇妙的境遇下，少年遇到了少女，于是他们共同踏上了旅程。
"No, that\'s not what I meant - I\'m not talking about video games. \nAh, never mind…",不，我不是这意思——我没说电子游戏。\n啊，算了，就当我没说……
"Damn, this cave goes on for a while. \nAre you sure there\'s an end to this?",该死，我们在这洞里走了好一段时间了。\n你确定这里有出路吗？
"Yeah, I\'m sure. \nI\'ve been through here before, it\'s just that, well... I\'ll tell you something when we get to the end.",是的，我确定。\n我以前来过这里，只要……我们找到出口，我就会告诉你怎么走的。

*cat hissing sounds*,*猫咪发出了嘶嘶声*
"Heh, well, the thing about that is... I didn\'t just need backup for that cyclops back there. \nThis is a big, dangerous world, and it just so happens that there\'s a fortress full of fascists over there, and they\'re preparing to start a war. \nI didn\'t want to scare you earlier, but we need to sneak past here - it\'s the only road forward.",嗨，好吧，事实就是……我在没有支援的情况下就能搞定后面那个独眼巨人。\n这是一个辽阔又危险的世界，正巧那边有个住满了法西斯主义者的要塞，而且他们正准备发动一场战争。\n我不是要吓唬你，但我们得从这偷偷溜过去，这是唯一能前进的道路。
"Ahhhh, you\'ve been hiding things from us. Very naughty! \nBut this is good news - we can test out our new powers on some proper bad guys. \nAnd I\'m sure you\'ll have no objections if we raid this castle for treasure, eh?",啊啊啊，你总是把东西给藏起来。真是太调皮了！\n不过也不是件坏事，你们这些坏家伙正适合拿来测试我们新的力量。\n我想你们不会反对我抢劫你们城堡内的宝物吧？
You\'re not scared? Or angry at me? \nThat\'s excellent to hear.,你不怕？还是生了我的气？\n听起来太棒了。
"If loot is all you care about, then there\'s sure to be a lot of that ahead. \nJust be careful not to get shot too many times. \nI know you\'re strong enough to take a few shots to the face, but you\'ll die eventually.",如果你只在乎战利品，那我可以告诉你前面肯定会有不少。\n小心点别被射到太多次。\n我知道你很耐打，子弹糊脸几次都干不掉你，不过大意的话你还是会死的。
Let\'s go for it. \nYou can stand behind me for safety if you like.,我们上吧。\n你要是害怕的话就站到我背后。
Meow!,喵！
This is horrible. \nThe destruction is so much worse now.        \n\nThis used to be lush woodlands around here!,太恐怖了。\n这里的破坏程度变得更严重了。        \n\n这周围原本都是绿色的林地！
"Wow, something REALLY BIG made this mess. \nI\'d be terrified if I wasn\'t so impressed.",哇，肯定有什么大家伙把这里弄得一团糟。\n要不是我对这里印象深刻，我也会被吓到的。
"I\'m no track expert, but it seems like these fascists have got a very big car. \nOne big enough to mow down trees - and probably us too.",我不是车辆专家，不过那些法西斯主义者似乎是拿到了巨型车辆。\n那可真是大到足以碾压树木——也许我们也会被碾压。
"But on the bright side, we\'d see something huge like that coming from a mile away! \nWe\'ll definitely be ready to fight it!",不过往好的方面说，我从一英里外就能看见那个大家伙正在冲过来！\n我们有足够的时间做好战斗准备！
"I suppose that\'s true. \nIt\'ll be an easy target for my magic, that\'s for sure.",你说太对了。\n我的魔法很容易就能瞄准它，这点我很确信。
Meeeow!,喵~！
What the hell was that? It came out of nowhere!            \n\nI\'ve got the worst headache imaginable... ,那是什么鬼？从哪冒出来的！            \n\n这是我经历过最难受的头痛了……
"Are you alive, NoLegs? \nDid you get hit?!            \n\nSay something to me - meow twice if you\'re okay!",你还活着吗，腿无？\n有没有受伤？！            \n\n跟我说点什么吧——要是没事你就喵两声！
M-meow... meow…,喵……喵……
W-what? Natalie\'s gone!?           \nHe took her! That scary guy took her!,什、什么？娜塔莉不见了！？           \n是他拐走了她！是那个吓人的家伙拐走了她！
Well I guess there\'s no question about what to do next: \nWe gotta go after them! No one steals from me and gets away with it!             \n\nAnd also who knows what he\'s gonna do to Natalie?!,好吧，接下来要做的事情已经很明显：\n我们要追上他们！没人可以从我这偷走东西还能自由自在的！             \n\n而且谁知道他会怎么对待娜塔莉呢？！
"Meow, meow!",喵，喵！
"We\'re down one party member, but I\'m sure we\'ll manage. \nWe got cocky is all, we\'re gonna be more careful this time.",虽然我们少了一名队友，不过我有信心我们能处理好这件事。\n之前我们太自以为是了，这次我们要更加小心。
"Wow, this fortress is massive.           \n\nI hope Natalie\'s okay.",哇，这要塞可真大。           \n\n希望娜塔莉能平安无事。
Myehehehe. \nMeow!,喵呵呵呵。\n喵！
Now\'s not the time for dirty jokes like that! \nYou take that back!,现在可不是说黄段子的时候！\n你还是把笑话收回去吧！
A chill just ran down my spine.            \nThere\'s another angry girl standing in front of me. \nThis is all too familiar now.,我的脊背开始发凉了。\n又有别的愤怒女孩站在我面前。\n这一幕似曾相识啊。
*Accusing stare*,*指责的眼光*
"What\'s that? You think she\'s here to fight the bad guys, and not us? \nYeah, that makes more sense.            \nMaybe we can explain our situation and join forces!",那是什么？你觉得她对付的是那些坏家伙，而不是我们？\n没错，你说得很有道理。            \n也许我们能解释我们的处境，然后跟她合作！
I shouldn\'t be too optimistic. \nI\'m probably gonna have a bad time if I take another step.,我不该太乐观的。\n要是再走一步的话，我可能不会太好过。
